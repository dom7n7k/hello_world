# hello_world

Just few lines of text on this document to see how github works in reality. 
If somebody have some questions, feel free to write me on GIThub. 

I am into many things. All the time i am exploring and question life around me. My skills are more soft, but from concepting point of view it is enough to put something inpirational to work on. 

Above you have really condesed information about me. Just to draw a picture in general of me and what you can excpect. 

Peace.
